# Anders Skarby's Presentations

This is a Github repository that's supposed to be a centralized repository of all my presentations.

Now, if there aren't that many, it's most likely because I've previously made presentations in Power Point and Keynote.... however, that
also implies that I need to make such presentations available in PDF form... and distribute them.

## Availability

The slides / presentations can be access (in their rendered form) from this [site][site].

## Technology

There's all based on [Reveal.js](reveal.js)
