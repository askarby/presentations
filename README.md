# Presentations (by Skarby)

This site contains all the presentations I give (well, the ones from "now on", that is). The reason
behind having a presentation site, is that I don't have to forward any presentations in varying formats,
generate PDF's from Keynote or PowerPoint etc.

# Contributing

I won't be taking contributions to the materials (that's at least not the plan, for now), but if you're
interested in how "this works", and you want to tinker then have a look at the 
[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)-file.
